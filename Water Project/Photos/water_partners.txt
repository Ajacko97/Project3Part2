We sell water


Water is a finite and irreplaceable resource that is fundamental to human well-being, it is only renewable if well managed, so our company is actively contributing to the development and implementation of sustainable water management solutions, by donating half of our profit to our collaborators that help in making this goal become reality.

We hope and struggle to achieve a more sustainable water use, not only in Denmark, but as far and wide as possible. We aim in expanding the nationâ€™s water supply through the reuse of municipal waste water and through water desalination plants, and last but not least, by educating people and raising awareness of the power and responsibility the human race has upon our earth.

We partner up


At Last Drop, we believe there is a better way to take care of the earth that is being our home. A more sustainable, less invasive way, where earth and humans live in a perfect symbiosis.
We are a company that was born from love towards our earth, simple people but obsessively passionate about what we do. 

We aimed and we still do, to inspire as many people as possible to get involved in saving our planet from becoming a dessert. Without the notable help that we have received from our sponsors and partners, we would not have been able to start this project or keep it alive and going. 
We are all equal in our need for water, and we are stronger together in the fight against losing it.
One has to fight to reach his dream, and we will not stop until we're there.
